# Global COVID-19 Data Exploration — SQL Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores global COVID-19 datasets using SQL to simulate real-world analytics workflows. The goal is to transform raw public health data into meaningful insights related to infection trends, mortality rates, and vaccination progress.

The analysis focuses on KPI development, trend exploration, and reporting techniques commonly used in business analytics environments.

## 📊 Key Analysis Areas

### Case & Mortality Analysis
- Total cases vs deaths
- Death percentage calculations
- Infection rate relative to population

### Geographic Trends
- Countries with highest infection ratios
- Population-adjusted death comparisons
- Continental breakdown analysis

### Global Metrics
- Aggregated global case and death KPIs

### Vaccination Analytics
- Rolling vaccination counts using window functions
- Population vaccination percentage tracking
- Reusable analytical datasets via CTEs and temp tables

---

## 🧠 Analytical Techniques Used
- NULL-safe calculations using `NULLIF`
- Partitioned rolling aggregations
- Dataset joins for multi-table analytics
- KPI-driven reporting logic
- Structured query workflows

---

## 📂 Dataset
Public global COVID-19 datasets containing case, death, and vaccination records across countries and time periods.

---

## 🚀 Project Outcome
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to clean, analyze, and model large real-world datasets to produce actionable insights — mirroring analytics workflows used in reporting, BI, and decision support environments.
